"""Resolve US government aircraft from their Mode S address.

The ADS-B feeds give a callsign and a type designator. For airline traffic the
callsign resolves to an operator via airlines.py. For an aircraft squawking its
registration - N911VH, say - there is nothing to resolve against, and the
honest fallback is "Private / General Aviation".

That fallback is wrong for a large and locally visible class of aircraft:
police, sheriff, fire and air-ambulance helicopters, which orbit at low level
and are exactly what a person looking up wants identified. They transmit an
N-number as their callsign and appear in no commercial aircraft database -
adsbdb.com and hexdb.io both 404 on them.

The FAA Releasable Aircraft Database does list them, keyed by the Mode S hex
that ADS-B transmits. This module ships a snapshot of the crewed, government-
registered rotorcraft from it and refreshes itself periodically.

SCOPE - this is deliberately inert outside the US:
  * The table only loads when the configured location is in US territory.
  * Lookups only run for hex addresses in the US ICAO block A00000-AFFFFF.
A user in Europe downloads nothing, parses nothing, and sees no change.

#
# Two reasons not to ship one:
#
#   * The integration refreshes itself at setup. __init__.py fires
#     async_refresh_registry as a background task immediately, then daily, and
#     _needs_refresh() is True when no cache exists - so a fresh install has a
#     current table within minutes, not after REFRESH_DAYS.

#     aircraft are on the FAA LADD list, and 8% of that table would go stale
#     the moment an operator enrolled. Shipping the FAA's own download instead

# The government table names 5,726 aircraft. Everything else - private jets,

# to lookup_operator, which can only match airline designators, and therefore
# shows "Private". Measured: 28 of 52 occupied slots.
#
# ⚠ SQLITE, NOT A DICT, and the reason is measured. 181,538 entries are 2.32 MB
# gzipped and 7.63 MB as JSON, but 51.6 MB as a Python dict - twenty-two times
# the file size. parse_faa_archive's docstring promises "peak memory is a few
# MB, so this is safe on a Pi" and that promise is load-bearing. On disk the
# same table is 10.7 MB and a lookup costs about 51 microseconds.
#
# ⚠ NOTHING IS SHIPPED. This is built from the archive the integration ALREADY
# downloads every REFRESH_DAYS for the government table.
#
# ⚠ INDIVIDUAL REGISTRANTS ARE EXCLUDED. Section 803 of the FAA
# Reauthorization Act of 2024 (49 USC 44114, effective 2025-03-28) defines
# personally identifiable information to include the name of the owner where
# the owner is an individual. TYPE REGISTRANT = 1 is dropped: 126,404 of
# 316,483 rows. That sounds fatal to the feature and is not - measured against
